# TCP Password Generator - Client/Server Application

This project is a simple TCP client/server application where the server acts as a password generator, responding to client requests with passwords generated according to specified criteria.

## Features

- The client automatically connects to the server using a predefined IP address and port.
- Upon connection, the server logs the clientâ€™s IP address and port (e.g., `New connection from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyyy`).
- The client can request different types of passwords:
  - `n`: Numeric password (only digits).
  - `a`: Alphabetic password (lowercase letters only).
  - `m`: Mixed password (lowercase letters and digits).
  - `s`: Secure password (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols).
- The client specifies the password type and length in a single input, e.g., `n 8` for an 8-character numeric password.
- The server generates the requested password and sends it back to the client, which then displays it.
- The client can continue making password requests or terminate the connection by entering `q`.

## Requirements

- A shared application protocol is defined in a `.h` header file.
- Password generation functions:
  - `generate_numeric()`
  - `generate_alpha()`
  - `generate_mixed()`
  - `generate_secure()`
- Input for password requests must be entered as a single line (e.g., `n 8`).
- Default IP address and port are used for both client and server, requiring no command-line arguments at startup.
- Password length must be between 6 and 32 characters.
- Code and comments are written in English.

## Technical Details

- The server can handle up to 5 simultaneous client connections (queue length: 5).
- The server runs indefinitely, waiting for new connections.
- The client terminates its process after disconnecting from the server using the `q` command.

## How to Run

1. Start the server:
   ```cmd
   server.exe
   ```
2. Start the client:
   ```cmd
   client.exe
   ```
3. Follow the client prompts to request passwords.

## Example Interaction

1. The client connects to the server:
   ```
   Connected to the server at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port
   ```
2. The client sends a request:
   ```
   Input: n 8
   ```
3. The server responds:
   ```
   Password: 45237891
   ```
4. The client can make another request or disconnect using `q`:
   ```
   Input: q
   Disconnected from the server.
   ```
